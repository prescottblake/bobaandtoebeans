					<p>Boba and Toe-Beans is a cat cafe run by cats!  Our head chefs are Apollo and Artemis. Service runs at a relaxed pace, to accomodate the many naps and stretch breaks that the cats require.  Please have patience as the chefs are natural contrarians, and may only be motivated to work on your order when it is least convenient for you.</p>

					<p>Artemis and Apollo are siblings, adopted from the Gig Harbor Humane Society. They lived in Seattle with their owners until moving to the Anacortes area to start their own cat cafe.</p>

					<p><span class="emphasis">Artemis</span> is a female brown tabby with dark markings and white underbelly.  Artemis may seem unwelcoming to guests due to her fierce resting face, but nothing makes her happier than a hello from the guests! Artemis takes pride in the quality of her teas and coffees at Boba and Toe-Beans.</p>

					<p><span class="emphasis">Apollo</span> is Boba and Toe-Beans head of baked goods!  He can be found every morning "making bread" to wake his owners.  He is a male orange tabby, and prides himself on being larger and fluffier than his sister, Artemis.  While Apollo can be skittish at first, he makes guests feel at home by doing what he loves the most: cuddling!</p>
